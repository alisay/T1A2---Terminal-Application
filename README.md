# Coronapp

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

This application provides a user with information related to the spread of COVID-19 internationally. It takes user input in the form of a country code, date, and desired statistic (of daily deaths, daily new cases, total cases, total deaths and total recoveries) and returns a number taken from an API relying on up-to-date World Health Organisation data. The application solves the problem of individuals needing to access information relating to public health, but being overwhelmed by complicated analyses, large amounts of data, or distracting graphical user interfaces. The goal is to allow concerned individuals to evaluate the comparative severity of the disease in different countries in order to inform their personal decisions, including travel plans, distancing strategy or degree of self-satisfaction. The user will use the application by entering a country, chosing which statistic they wish to view and entering a date. This will return a statistic in the form of a sentence string. The user can use the help menu to view a directory of countries and the codes to be used within the command line arguments, a list of statistics that are available, and instructions on date formatting. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'coronapp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install coronapp

## Usage

This app takes three terminal line arguments: country, date and statistic. 

For example, from the root directory of the Gemfile, you can run:  

```bash
    ./exe/coronapp -c "AU" -d "20 April 2020" -s "toll" 
```

This will return the total deaths from coronavirus in Australia on 20 April this year. 

If you forget these instructions, just run the --help command. 

```bash
    ./exe/coronapp -h
```

The available statistics are: 

New --> returns the new cases of coronavirus on this day
Deaths --> returns the number of deaths from coronavirus on this day
Total --> returns the total number of coronavirus cases on this day
Recovered --> returns the number of people who have recovered from coronavirus
Toll --> returns the total number of deaths from coronavirus 

The countries whose statistics can be accessed are: 

    AF Afghanistan      DE Germany          PK Pakistan

## Features

This app has three features: 

1. Scrape 

This is a module which defines a static function taking three variables as arguments: country, date and statistic. It scrapes a url using the gem open-uri. This url is taken from an online API, and completed as a string using the country argument. The data returned from this is saved into a local variable. Using the json gem, the same function parses this variable and returns the relevant statistic. In order to do this, it uses a private class to define a function which translates the user-entered statistic into a well-formed string. Error handling inherits from the standard class. I have ensured that user input which is a date object or wrongly capitalized can be handled. 

2. Opt-Parse

This is a class for analysing the arguments entered in the command line by the user, using the Option Parser gem which is bundled with ruby. It specifies the arguments which are mandatory - country, date, and statistic - as well as outlining what type of variable it expects these to be, and automatically generates a help menu for the commands. Using the optparse/date module, I can coerce the string entered as an argument for date into a date object. Opt-parse also allows me to store the arguments in a hash, which is used as an argument in the get function described above. 

3. Main function

This code handles the arguments specified in opt-parse above and returns a string with the scrape module method interpolated. The error handling at this stage rescues an error where there are insufficient arguments and an error where there are invalid arguments and ensures that a well formed error message is returned, which suggests that the user access the help menu.  


## User Interaction and Experience	 

The user will learn how to interact with the application through a README file accessible on the public github repository. This file will explain how to install the app as well as install any dependencies using bundle install. It will also include usage instructions with examples. During use of the application, if a user enters incorrect information – for example, if a user were to enter too few arguments – the application will prompt the user as to the nature of the error and suggest that they view the help menu of the application by typing --help. These choices have been made to closely mirror how command line applications typically function, rather than mimicking the style of a graphical user interface

## Implementation Plan

The things I need to do to make this app are listed below. As I researched how to do these things and then incorporated the results into my code (while continuously testing to ensure performance was as expected), I checked off the items from the list below in trello. 

* Learn how to use github to version control my work
* Write a readme and software development plan including features. 
* Make a control flow diagram of how I expect the app to work.
* Write some tests using rspec about how I expect the program to work
* Learn how to make an executable file that takes arguments from the command line using ARGV
* Find an API that will provide corona virus statistics I am interested in.
* Understand the structure of the API and which options I will need to require from the user in order to return a sensible result. 
* Find a way to make an http call to the API and return the results as json
* Find a way to parse the result
* Fix the errors that the gem is throwing because of its basic settings
* Write a function which takes the arguments and returns the number I am interested in. 
* Find a way of taking arguments from the command line 
* Find a way of generating a help menu 
* Learn how to make a gem using bundle gem coronapp to create a sensible file structure for my app.
* Make a way of caching results 
* Find a way of validating dates entered to ensure that people aren't entering from before or after data exists

See [trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/pc6pvNan/539072041e9035a6fe2a3abbf52086e8/coronapp) for further details. 

## Manual Testing 

**Test**|**Expected Outcome**|**Actual Outcome**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
I enter a search for Australia |A json file is saved to the cache folder which contains the data from the australia webpage |As expected
I enter a search for Australia a second time|The json file above is not modified|As expected
I manually remove the date in my search from the saved Australia cache and search again|The json file above is updated to include the date again|As expected
I enter a search for -c "AU" -d "20 April 2020" -s "deaths"|I will be returned the string "There were 0 new daily deaths on this day"|As expected
I enter a search for -c "AU" -d "40 April 2020" -s "deaths"|I will be returned the message "Invalid argument: -d 40 april 2020. Run "coronapp" --help for details."|As expected
I enter a search for -c "AU" -d  "20 Fleburary 2020" -s "deaths"|I will be returned the message "Invalid argument: -d 20 Fleburary 2020. Run "coronapp" --help for details."|FAIL - returned "There were  new daily deaths on this day" Fix this!
I call the help menu|The help menu is returned|As expected
I call the app without any arguments|I receive the message "Insufficient arguments. Run "coronapp" --help for details."|As expected
I enter a search for -c "XX" -d "20 April 2020" -s "toll"|Mate, I hope it breaks but I'm pretty sure it's not going to because I don't have data validation for this|FAIL - as expected, not having a way of handling this meant that it wasn't handled
I enter a search for --cOuNtRy "uS" --dAtE "24/02/2020" -sTaT "tOtAl"|I will be returned the message "There were 51 total cases on this day"|As expected

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
